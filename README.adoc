= Context-Adaptive Arithmetic Coding with Scaling 

A simple implementation of compression method known as context-adaptive arithmetic coding with scaling. What does it mean?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding[Arithmetic Coding] - coding method used in this program.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-adaptive_binary_arithmetic_coding[Context-Adaptive] - means that the the length of the codes depends on a frequency of individual bytes.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding#Precision_and_renormalization[with Scaling] - there is no problem with number precision.

|===
^|Project | Description

^.^|AC_Core
|Core functionality of arithmetic coding. All logic is there including file i/o. This project produces [underline]#static library# that is used in _AC_CLI_ and _AC_Core_Tests_ as a dependency.

^.^|AC_CLI
|Command-Line Interface for _AC_Core_ functions. This project produces executable program called `ac` (by default).

^.^|AC_Core_Tests
|Collection of unit tests for _AC_Core_ functionalities. This project produces executable with embeded CLI from Catch2. For more info read https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md[official docs].
|===

=== External libraries

_AC_Core_ library doesn't have any external dependencies except C++ standard library.

* https://github.com/bfgroup/Lyra[Lyra] provides command-line arguments parser for _AC_CLI_.
* https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2[Catch2] is used in _AC_Core_Tests_ as a testing framework.

== Building

You need https://premake.github.io/download.html[Premake5] to easily generate project files (e.g. for Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Xcode, GNU Make and more)

In root folder run `premake5` with an argument depending on IDE you want to use. For example, run: `premake5 vs2019` if you want to generate project for Visual Studio 2019.

== Tests

Project _AC_Core_Tests_ contains all the tests for _AC_Core_. You can build it and run executable `ac_core_tests` to verify tests.
