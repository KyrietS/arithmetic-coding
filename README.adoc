= Context-Adaptive Arithmetic Coding with Scaling 

A simple implementation of compression method known as context-adaptive arithmetic coding with scaling. What does it mean?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding[Arithmetic Coding] - coding method used in this program.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-adaptive_binary_arithmetic_coding[Context-Adaptive] - means that the the length of the codes depends on a frequency of individual bytes.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding#Precision_and_renormalization[with Scaling] - there is no problem with number precision.

== Usage

Type `ac --help` to get help. General usage:
----
ac (--encode|--decode) [-o,-s] source [dest]
----
=== Available options
----
  -e,--encode                 Encode a file
  -d,--decode                 Decode a file
  -h,--help                   Print help message and exit
  -o,--override               Whether output file should override existing file.
  -s,--stats                  Print stats during and after encoding process.
----
By default `dest` is set to `{source}.ac`.

=== Examples

*Encoding file with stats printed out* (`dest` file must not exist)
----
./ac --encode -s file.txt output.ac
----
*Decoding file with progress bar* (`dest file will be overwritten`)
----
./ac -dso output.ac file2.txt
----


== Project structure

There are currently 3 projects in this workspace.


[%autowidth]
|===
^|Project | Description

^.^|AC_Core
|Core functionality of arithmetic coding. All logic is there including file i/o. This project produces [underline]#static library# that is used in _AC_CLI_ and _AC_Core_Tests_ as a dependency.

^.^|AC_CLI
|Command-Line Interface for _AC_Core_ functions. This project produces executable program called `ac` (by default).

^.^|AC_Core_Tests
|Collection of unit tests for _AC_Core_ functionalities. This project produces executable with embeded CLI from Catch2. For more info read https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md[official docs].
|===

=== External libraries

_AC_Core_ library doesn't have any external dependencies except C++ standard library.

* https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11[CLI11] provides command-line arguments parser for _AC_CLI_.
* https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2[Catch2] is used in _AC_Core_Tests_ as a testing framework.

== Building

You need https://premake.github.io/download.html[Premake5] to easily generate project files (e.g. for Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Xcode, GNU Make and more)

In root folder run `premake5` with an argument depending on IDE you want to use. For example, run: `premake5 vs2019` if you want to generate project for Visual Studio 2019.

=== Visual Studio (Windows)
In root folder run `premak5 vs2019`. Visual Studio solution with projects will be generated. Open `Arithmetic Coder.sln` with Visual Studio. Everything should be configured properly to build, run and test the program.

=== Makefile (Linux)
In root folder run `premake5 [--cc=gcc|clang] gmake2`. If `--cc` option is not set, then default C++ compiler will be used. Makefile files structure will be generated. In root folder run `make help` to get available build options. General usage is:
----
make [config=release|debug] [target]

TARGETS:
    all (default)
    AC_CLI
    AC_Core
    AC_Core_Tests
----

Executable binaries are stored in `bin/` folder. Release config is used by default.

*Importnat note:* Because of using `<filesystem>` standard library in `AC_CLI`, `AC_Core` and `AC_Core_Tests` projects it is necessary to have it installed on your computer. If you generate project for *gcc* then library `stdc\++fs` is automatically linked via `-l` option. Note that `<filesystem>` library is available in gcc since version _8.x_. In earlier versions there was `<experimental/filesystem>`. Since version _9.x_ of gcc it's not necessary to link against `stdc++fs` anymore. *Clang* was not tested.

== Tests

Project _AC_Core_Tests_ contains all the tests for _AC_Core_. You can build it and run executable `ac_core_tests` to verify tests.
